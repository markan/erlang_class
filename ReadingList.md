#### Starting reading list

##### Learn you some erlang

http://learnyousomeerlang.com/
It's worth reading these sections:
1. Introduction
2. Starting Out
3. Starting Out (for real)
   In the near term, you can skip reading bit syntax and binary comprehensions
4. Modules
5. Syntax in Functions
   This will be very different from what you're used to if you're coming from Ruby or Python
6. Types
7. A short visit to common data structures, especially the records section.

##### The Erlang Handbook

https://github.com/esl/erlang-handbook/tree/master/output

A very detailed journey through all the core Erlang concepts.  Does not discuss OTP.
It's been a couple of years since it was updated, but it's still very much relevant.
Sections 2-5 complement the Learn You Some Erlang content well for a more direct approach
to the same material outlined above.

##### Erlang Getting Started.
Online at http://erlang.org/doc/getting_started/users_guide.html, or
