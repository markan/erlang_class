# What is Erlang?
## Erlang is:

* A pure functional programming language
* Designed for massive concurrency
* It's OTP library provides a good pattern for resiliency

---
# What is Erlang?
## Erlang is not:
* A particularly good *systems* programming language
* A way to get bare metal speed (but think twice before you say you
need that)
* Terribly similar to other common languages; learning curve is a thing

---
# What is this class about?

* Helping people new to Erlang get started
* Introducing the 'Chef Style' of Erlang
* Overview of the core Erlang components used by Chef 
* ... and the occasional deeper dive into interesting topics as we
  find them.
* It will be opinionated.

Guest sessions are welcome!

# This is not a substitute for the many good resources on erlang
* "Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good" is my favorite

  http://learnyousomeerlang.com or buy the book

* "Erlang Programming" by Francesco Cesarini and Simon Thompson, O'Reilly Press

  It's what I learned Erlang from, but it's not been updated in a while

* "Erlang and OTP in Action" by Eric Merritt, Martin Logan, and Richard Carlsson, Manning Press

   This covers some introductory material, but where it really shines is in it's coverage of the OTP runtime system.

---
# Why does Chef use Erlang?

* Functional/actor model makes it easy to reason about concurrency

* Erlang's OTP library makes it easy to build resilient systems

* Easily scales to tens of thousands of threads

* Per thread garbage collection makes handling web requests very
efficient

* Incredibly powerful built-in inspection tools for live systems. (Trace anything)

---
# OTP and the 'let it crash philosophy'

* Error handling and recovery is hard

* The recovery process can be complex

* Instead, restart subsystems to put them in a known state

* Erlang/OTP is built around that approach

???
In some senses sophisticated error handling and recovery becomes an *optimization*

---
# What parts of Erlang don't we use?
* Distributed Erlang (multiple hosts)

* Live systems update

???
Distributed erlang is really amazing, but there are some blockers
(security), and we've not really *needed* it yet.
 
---
# ERL
## Erlang has a REPL 'erl'
```erlang
% erl
> 1 + 1.
2
```
* If a line begins with a '>' it's intended for _erl_
* Commas separate expressions
* Periods terminate 'statements'

## The erl shell is a powerful tool
* Beyond the normal uses of a repl it can also be used to connect to other running instances

???
A later session will go into the shell in more detail

---
# A whiplash inducing tour of Erlang syntax
* Expressions
* Types
* Variables
* Functions
* Matching

???
This is well covered elsewhere, and we'll focus on a small subset and the particularly unique parts of Erlang

---
# Everything in erlang is an expression.
* Expressions are separated by commas, not semicolons (like most every other language)
* Expressions produce values
* That includes functions!

---
# Numeric data types:
## Integers are bignums
```erlang
> 1024*1024*1024*1024.  
1099511627776
> 1099511627776*1099511627776.
1208925819614629174706176
> 1208925819614629174706176 * 1208925819614629174706176.
1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976
```
## Floats are IEEE 754 64 bit
```erlang
> 2 *  3.141592653589793.
6.283185307179586
```
???
Integers are coerced to floats when mixed
---
# atoms are a literal constant with a name
* Similar to ruby symbols
* lowercase strings are interpreted as atoms
* or any text quoted with a "'"
```erlang
> foo.
foo
> bar.
bar.
> 'a really odd symbol'
'a really odd symbol'
```

---
# Lists
## Lists have a variable number of terms
```erlang
[ ]
[ 1 ]
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
```
## Lists are essentially linked lists
```erlang
[ Head | Tail ]
```
* Tail can be a list

## You can build lists by prepending onto other lists
```
 > [ 1 | [ 2, 3 ] ].
[1,2,3]
```
---
# Tuples 
* Have a fixed number of terms.
```erlang
> {}.
> { 1, 2, 3 }.
```
* Often used to create 'typed' values
```erlang
> {seconds, 10}.
```
* Also used to build proplists
```erlang
> [{ timeout, 10 }, {count, 5}].
```

* Tuples are used to build records (later)

---
# Variables are Capitalized strings

* Variables can be bound or unbound
* Binding can be done with the '=' operator
```erlang
> X = 1.
> Y = 2.
> X + Y.
```
* Once bound they are immutable
```erlang
> X = 1.
1
> X = 2.
** exception error: no match of right hand side value 2
```
* Rebinding throws a bad match because '=' is a pattern match operator (more later) 
---
# Named Functions
* 
```erlang
add(A, B) ->
  1, 
  A + B.
```
* The name is an atom
* The variables in the arguments are bound on entry
* The body is a comma separated set of expressions
* The last expression is the return value
* Defined at the top level of a module (no nested named functions)
* Can't be defined in the REPL.
---
# Anonymous Functions
## Functions can be defined anonymously

* Here we bind a fun to the add variable
```erlang
Add = fun(A, B) -> A + B end.
```
* And here it is called at a later point
```erlang
Add(1, 2).
```
* We can bind a named function to a variable
```erlang
Add = fun add/2
```
* Functions capture their surrounding context
???
More in the functional programming session

# Pattern matching:
## It's the heart of Erlang syntax
* the '=' operator is not like other languages;
* it's not assignment but a pattern matching operator
* The left hand side can be a mix of:
  * unbound variables
  * bound variables
  * constants

???
If there's one thing I want people to walk away with it's this.

---
# Pattern matching is not assignment

* Simple matches look like assignment
```erlang
A = 1.
B = foobar.
```
* But as we saw before, unbound variables become bound by a match
```erlang
> A = 1. % Now A is bound to 1
1
> A = 1. % A is already bound, but the values match
1
> A = 2. 
** exception error: no match of right hand side value 2
```
---
# More complex patterns can be matched:
* They can contain a mix of bound and unbound variables.
```erlang
> A = 1.
> {A, B, 3} = {1, 2, 3}.
{1,2,3}
> B.
2
```
* Matches don't need any variables
```erlang
ok = DoSomething().
```
* when a match fails, we get a bad_match exception.

That's useful in combination with the fail fast philosophy
---
# Case statements
    
## Case statements are built from pattern matches
```erlang
case N of ->
  0 -> 0;
  1 -> 1;
  X -> 1/X
end
```
* Clauses are separated by ';'
* Terminated by 'end'
* Case statements do not need to be exhaustive
* First match succeeds
* Free variables on the left hand side of the '->' will be bound on
the right hand side. 

---
# Case statements can have guards
```erlang
case N of
  X when X < 0 -> negative;
  1 -> one;
  2 -> two;
  X when X < 5 -> many;
  X -> infinity
end.
```
* Guards are limited expressions
* no function calls or anything too complex
	  
---
# Matches can be quite complex
```erlang
count(TreeNode) ->
  case TreeNode of
    {leaf, Data} -> 1;
    {node, undefined, undefined} -> 1;
    {node, undefined, RN} -> count(RN);
    {node, LN, undefined} -> count(LN);
    {node, LN, RN} -> count(LN) + count(RN)
  end.
```

---
# Function heads can also be match statements
```erlang
fact(1) ->
  1;
fact(X) -> 
  X * fact(X-1).
```
* This is a very common idiom and can create some beautiful code
---
# No looping in erlang
## Recursion 
* Variables in a function aren't mutable; how do we update state?
* We call ourselves with the new state
```erlang
loop(0, Acc) ->
  ok;
loop(N, Acc) ->
  loop(N-1, Acc+1).
```

## Erlang is fully tail recursive
* If the last expression in a function is a function call, 
* More on that when we do the functional programming and erlang (session 3)
